##  O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> **‚ÄúSoftware entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.‚Äù**
> ‚Äî Bertrand Meyer

###  What it means:

* We **shouldn‚Äôt have to modify existing code** to add new behavior.
* Instead, we should be able to **extend** it (typically via **inheritance** or **composition** or **strategy** pattern).

---

## example:

> I have a class `Invoice` with a method `saveToDB()`
> If tomorrow I add `saveToFile()`, I'm modifying the same class ‚Äî which **violates OCP**.

### üéØ Why?

Because adding `saveToFile()` means:

* We're modifying existing code
* Risk of breaking something that‚Äôs already tested
* Harder to maintain/test over time

---

## Better Approach

Let‚Äôs refactor using **OCP** ‚Äî by introducing an interface:

```java
public interface InvoiceSaver {
    void save(Invoice invoice);
}
```

Then:

### DB Save Implementation

```java
public class DBInvoiceSaver implements InvoiceSaver {
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to save to DB
    }
}
```

### File Save Implementation

```java
public class FileInvoiceSaver implements InvoiceSaver {
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to save to file
    }
}
```

### Tomorrow ‚Äî Save to S3?

Just create:

```java
public class S3InvoiceSaver implements InvoiceSaver {
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to save to S3
    }
}
```

Now our original `Invoice` or main workflow **doesn‚Äôt change at all** ‚Äî we just plug in a new saver.

---

##  Benefits:

* **Testability** ‚Äî each implementation can be unit tested independently
* **Extensibility** ‚Äî we can add new ways to save invoices without touching old code
* **No regression risk** ‚Äî old, tested code remains untouched

---

##  Optional ‚Äî Strategy Pattern for runtime flexibility

If we want to dynamically switch strategies (e.g., based on config or input), we can inject the right saver at runtime.

```java
public class InvoiceService {
    private final InvoiceSaver saver;

    public InvoiceService(InvoiceSaver saver) {
        this.saver = saver;
    }

    public void saveInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
        saver.save(invoice);
    }
}
```

Now use different implementations as needed:

```java
InvoiceService service = new InvoiceService(new DBInvoiceSaver());
service.saveInvoice(invoice);
```

Or file, or S3, etc.
