```
I in SOLID means that interfaces should be designed so that clients are not forced to implement unnecessary functions they do not need. For example, if a RestaurantEmployee interface has methods like washDishes(), serveCustomer(), and cookFood(), and a Waiter class implements this interface, it will be forced to implement unnecessary functions. This is incorrect. Therefore, the interface should be segmented into smaller, more specific pieces.

```
### Analogy:

A **Restaurant Employee Interface** forces all employees to:

* `washDishes()`
* `serveCustomer()`
* `cookFood()`

Now if the **Waiter** class is forced to implement `washDishes()` and `cookFood()`,
that is unnecessary → violates ISP.

 Instead → Create smaller interfaces:

* `CookingStaff` → `cookFood()`
* `ServingStaff` → `serveCustomer()`
* `CleaningStaff` → `washDishes()`

Now Waiter implements `ServingStaff`,
Chef implements `CookingStaff`,
Cleaner implements `CleaningStaff`.

###  Technical Explanation:

**ISP = Interface should not force client to implement things they do not need.**
Instead → split big fat interface into **small role-based interfaces**.

---

### What happens if ISP is violated?

Large Interfaces → Difficult to maintain
Unused methods → Empty or dummy code
Fragile system → Adding a method breaks everything

 If followed → More flexible, reusable, role-specific code
 Easy to mock/test

### Real World Example (Spring Boot):

Assume a Spring Boot system where:

 Interface `NotificationService` defines:

```java
public interface NotificationService {
    void sendEmail(String msg);
    void sendSMS(String msg);
    void sendPushNotification(String msg);
}
```

Now, **EmailNotificationService** is forced to implement:

```java
@Override
public void sendSMS(String msg) {
    // not supported!
}
@Override
public void sendPushNotification(String msg) {
    // not supported!
}
```

→ BAD design → Violates ISP

---

### Better Design:

```java
public interface EmailNotification {
    void sendEmail(String msg);
}

public interface SMSNotification {
    void sendSMS(String msg);
}

public interface PushNotification {
    void sendPushNotification(String msg);
}
```

Now:

```java
@Service
public class EmailNotificationService implements EmailNotification {
    public void sendEmail(String msg) {
        // send email
    }
}

@Service
public class SMSNotificationService implements SMSNotification {
    public void sendSMS(String msg) {
        // send sms
    }
}
```

---

### Summary for backend:

✅ **Where ISP helps in Spring Boot**:

* Notification systems (email, sms, push)
* Payment providers (card, paypal, upi)
* Storage systems (S3, FTP, local disk)
* Report exporters (PDF, Excel, CSV)

**already explained it very well!**
"Interface should not force clients to implement unnecessary functions — split into small pieces(interfaces)."
